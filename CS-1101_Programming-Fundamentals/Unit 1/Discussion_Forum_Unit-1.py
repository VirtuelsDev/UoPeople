# # Discussion Assignment: Setting Up Python Environment
# ---
# *Setting up the Python environment is the first step in our programming journey.*
# *Let's explore the given statements and understand their outputs:*

# In[15]:
print('Hello, World!')

# *Output:* `Hello, World!`
# *Explanation:* This statement uses the `print` function to display the string `"Hello, World!"` on the console.  
# It's a common tradition to start programming by printing this simple message.

# In[16]:
1/2

# *Output:* `0.5`
# *Explanation:* In Python 3, division of integers results in a float. Here, 1 divided by 2 yields 0.5.

# In[17]:
type(1/2)

# *Output:* `<class 'float'>`
# *Explanation:* The `type` function is used to determine the type of the expression `1/2`, which is a float.

# In[18]:
print(01)

# *Explanation:* Although the leading zero might suggest octal notation, in Python 3, it is treated as a syntax error. 
# The correct way to write this would be `print(0o1)` for octal representation.

# In[19]:

1/(2/3)
# *Output:* `1.5`
# 
# *Explanation:* The expression `1/(2/3)` is equivalent to `1 * (3/2)`, resulting in 1.5.

# *Question for Discussion:*
# What challenges did you encounter while setting up the Python environment and how did you overcome them?

# Personally, I encountered a few challenges when setting up the Python environment, including versioning, dependencies, and package management. 
# I had to use tools like pip, virtualenv and Anaconda to create isolated virtual environments, then install Jupyter Notebook and the necessary packages. 
# I also had to learn how to use basic terminal commands to navigate directories and run Python scripts. 
# It wasn't easy at first, but I found a lot of resources online that helped me troubleshoot. 
# I think this is a useful skill for any Python developer to learn. What do you think ?
