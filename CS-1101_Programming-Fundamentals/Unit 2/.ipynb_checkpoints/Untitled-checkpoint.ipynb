    "Chained conditionals and nested conditionals are both structures used in programming for making decisions based on different conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chained Conditionals:\n",
    "In a chained conditional, multiple conditions are evaluated in sequence. If the first condition is false, the program moves on to evaluate the next condition, and so on. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def chained_example(x):\n",
    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "        print(\"Positive\")\n",
    "    elif x < 0:\n",
    "        print(\"Negative\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Zero\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example call\n",
    "chained_example(5)\n",
    "In this example, if x is greater than 0, it prints \"Positive.\" If x is less than 0, it prints \"Negative.\" If neither condition is met, it prints \"Zero.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested Conditionals:\n",
    "In nested conditionals, an if statement is placed inside another if statement. The inner if statement is executed only if the outer if statement is true. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def nested_example(x):\n",
    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "        print(\"Positive\")\n",
    "        if x % 2 == 0:\n",
    "            print(\"Even\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Odd\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Non-positive\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example call\n",
    "nested_example(7)\n",
    "In this example, if x is greater than 0, it prints \"Positive.\" Inside this block, it checks if x is even or odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Nested Conditionals:\n",
    "Nested conditionals can be avoided by restructuring the code to use logical operators. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def single_conditional_example(x):\n",
    "    if x > 0 and x % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        print(\"Positive and Even\")\n",
    "    elif x > 0:\n",
    "        print(\"Positive and Odd\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Non-positive\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example call\n",
    "single_conditional_example(7)\n",
    "This single conditional accomplishes the same logic as the nested example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question for Discussion:\n",
    "How do you decide between using chained conditionals and nested conditionals in your code, considering readability and maintainability?"
