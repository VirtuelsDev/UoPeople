The decision to enter the academic world at this particular stage of my life is a well thought out merger of personal and professional considerations. After having acquired considerable experience in the labor market, carrying out the imperative need to increase my skills and knowledge for a sustained competitiveness on a dynamic labor market was an engine. This consciousness, associated with an ardent desire for personal development and a rooted passion for emerging technologies, propelled me to a pivotal choice - the choice to embark on an academic journey to transform.

Armed with a baccalaureate in mathematics and economic engineering, my professional trajectory was enriched by roles of administrative assistant and junior consultant in computer engineering at Access Technologies International (ATI SARL). Specializing in project management with agile approaches, optimization, software architecture and applications development, this professional training serves as a solid basis for my decision to dive into the vast field of computer science. This academic chase is perfectly aligned with my aspirations in information analysis, artificial intelligence and the avant-garde of technological progress. The computer program, carefully chosen, promises to provide not only an education but a transformative experience, offering a robust base in crucial study areas. I firmly believe that obtaining a baccalaureate not only will unlock new opportunities, but will also amplify my impact during research efforts in the fields of information analysis and artificial intelligence.

The holder of a license in the genius of the mathematical economy marked the start of a trip to reach the management roles. This path consisted in applying the skills acquired thanks to training projects and practical projects to provide substantial contributions to the professional landscape. I work as an administrative assistant and junior consultant in computer engineering at Access Technologies International (ATI SARL) and earlier as a junior consultant at the African Institute of Rural Bio-Economy (IABER), where the accent was put on The collection, processing and processing of data analysis, the trajectory of my professional life is aligned with fundamental values, growth potential and aspiration to have a significant societal impact. The skills and knowledge acquired thanks to this academic prosecution are about to be essential to succeed in these areas, which would equivalen the tools necessary to navigate the complexity of information and artificial intelligence.

Although the prospect of returning to studies receives real enthusiasm, it is prudent to recognize that certain concerns persist. The most important concern revolves around the delicate balance of academic responsibilities with work and family commitments. In addition, there are apprehensions about potential academic challenges and the process of adaptation to the learning environment after a break. However, these concerns are not dissuasite; Rather, they serve as catalysts for a more conscientious and resilient approach to this educational journey. Effective time management, the search for support if necessary and maintain an unshakable concentration on my objectives are the cornerstones of my strategy to navigate these concerns.

Essentially, this return to the academic world symbolizes more than a simple academic prosecution, it marked by a commitment to personal and professional progress. The Baccalaureate program in computer science aligns perfectly with my professional trajectory, and I am optimistic about the various opportunities it will reveal. Despite the existing concerns, I approach this educational journey with courage and an unshakable dedication to the extraction of the greatest value of this transformative experience.
