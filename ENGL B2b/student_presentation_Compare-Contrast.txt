Hello everyone, my name is Benewende Pierre BONKOUNGOU.
Today I will present my comparison between two popular operating systems: Microsoft Windows and Ubuntu Linux.

Presentation of the students.
Compare/Contrast: ENGL B2b, Unit 1

This involves comparing two operating systems: Windows and Ubuntu.
Elements or aspects I will compare/contrast:
           A. Microsoft Windows operating systems
           B. Ubuntu Linux Operating Systems

I prefer aspect B, which is the Ubuntu operating system.
My choice for Ubuntu is based on personal preferences, including security, stability, and availability of open source software.
 

In terms of security and stability:

Windows has improved its security, but it remains vulnerable to malware and viruses. Windows is often prone to system crashes.

Ubuntu is known for its security as an open source system and for its stability with less disruptions.


In terms of cost and availability of software

Window has an extensive library of proprietary software but requires the purchase of licenses.

Ubuntu is free and open source, with no cost to the operating system with thousands of free software packages.

In terms of personalization

Windows offers limited customization options.

Ubuntu offers many customization options for a personalized look.

What is the main idea you want your reader to take away from your Compare/Contrast presentation?

The key message I want my audience to understand from my compare/contrast presentation is that Ubuntu Linux is a wise choice because of its security, stability, cost-effectiveness, and customization options.
It is a valuable alternative to Windows for users with these preferences and needs.
